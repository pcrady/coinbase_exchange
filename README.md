# coinbase_exchange

An unofficial library for the coinbase cloud exchange.

## Getting Started

This project is a Dart implementation of the
[coinbase exchange api](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/exchange/reference/exchangerestapi_getaccounts).
This api allows for the retrieval of real time pricing data as well and information about
individual profiles on coinbase and coinbase pro. It also allows for the trading of
cryptocurrencies on the coinbase pro platform. This package uses api keys which must be generated
from [coinbase pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) or the [coinbase pro sandbox](https://public.sandbox.pro.coinbase.com/).
